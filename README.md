# Double-Pendulum-Simulation
Language used : C++
Library : OpenFrameworks (here's their github --- https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks)

Some concepts used here were learnt from Daniel Shiffman's Nature of Code (Link to the book : https://wtf.tw/ref/shiffman.pdf)

Only the source code lives here


A LOT of help from this link : https://www.myphysicslab.com/pendulum/double-pendulum-en.html










P.S.  The formulae were a pain to type out ....


## A few pictures ...
